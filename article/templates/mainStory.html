                          <p>
                            The screen glowed softly in the dim room, its white emptiness almost taunting. A blank page—silent, cold, waiting.
                            <br><br>
                            For many, it was just a browser with nothing to show. For her, it was the first step toward something deeply personal. Her first website. Her portfolio. Her story—translated into pixels and design—was about to take shape.
                          </p>
                      
                          <p>
                            No one handed her a roadmap. There were no professors by her side, no technical mentors guiding every step. It was just her, a search bar, endless tutorials, and a dream quietly growing stronger with every sleepless night.
                          </p>
                      
                          <p>
                            The journey began with understanding the basics—the very bones of a webpage. Learning how the browser speaks, how it understands structure and hierarchy. Beneath its simplicity hid a logic she had to unravel on her own.
                            Every element placed was a victory. Every mistake, a lesson. She slowly learned to think like the web itself.
                          </p>
                      
                          <p>
                            But bones weren’t enough. Her creation needed shape, beauty, harmony. That’s when she dove into the world of design—how things looked, felt, and flowed.
                            She studied the details: color theory, spacing, alignment, responsiveness. It was like learning a new language of elegance.
                            Mistakes came often—buttons misaligned, layouts broken—but she adjusted, iterated, improved.
                          </p>
                      
                          <p>
                            She stumbled into a toolkit meant for rapid design—a collection of tools and templates that helped her piece things together with more ease.
                            It didn’t replace the struggle, but it softened it. She began to see her site come alive. It had movement, polish—something close to professionalism.
                            Each new page she crafted felt more real, more hers.
                          </p>
                      
                          <p>
                            Still, it wasn’t enough. Her site needed to do more than just look pretty. It needed to <strong>do</strong> things. She began to think about interactivity—how websites respond, how they behave.
                            Errors and confusion often mocked her, but she pressed on. She learned to make things dynamic—how clicks could trigger actions, how information could flow and shift with the user.
                          </p>
                      
                          <p>
                            The more she built, the more her site outgrew its static shell. It needed depth. A brain.
                            That’s when she discovered a framework that promised to bring it all together—to turn scattered pieces into a single working system.
                            It was daunting, filled with strange terms and layers. She considered quitting more than once.
                          </p>
                      
                          <p>
                            But help came—structure and support—in the form of a course at <strong>Tuwaiq Academy</strong>.
                            There, the overwhelming became achievable. Day by day, lesson by lesson, she built systems behind the screen—databases, logins, forms.
                            The logic she feared became second nature. Her content became alive, relational, manageable.
                          </p>
                      
                          <p>
                            There were days it felt like too much. One problem led to another, eyes weary from trying to solve the unsolvable.
                            But she never quit. She breathed, walked away, returned—and overcame.
                          </p>
                      
                          <p>
                            And now? The blank screen was gone.
                            In its place stood a living, breathing portfolio. A digital home for her journey, her growth, her pride.
                            It wasn’t just a website. It was <strong>proof</strong>—of sacrifice, persistence, and transformation.
                          </p>
                      
                          <p>
                            She clicked through her final project. Every page told a part of her story. From that first line of HTML, through the art of design,
                            the power of interactivity, and the logic of a strong framework—her journey was etched into every scroll, every shadow, every pixel.
                          </p>
                      
                          <p>
                            And when she finally published it to the world, she smiled—not because it was perfect, but because <strong>it was hers</strong>.
                          </p>
